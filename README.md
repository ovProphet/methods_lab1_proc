Concerning trees and bushes

The program takes an input filename and an output filename as command line arguments.
The input file structure is the following: it consists of N pairs of strings: the first includes an integer 1 or 2 standing for "a tree" or "a bush" respectively, the second includes description of a tree/bush - its name and its age/blooming month (an integer from 0 to 11 starting from January) separated by whitespace.
The output file contents are constructed according to the input: first, the number of plants in the full container is written thereafter the plants' information is given. Then the empty container information comes - and just to check the empty container is printed.
